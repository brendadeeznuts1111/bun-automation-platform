## `Bun.Image` — Built-in Image Processing[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#bun-image-built-in-image-processing)

Bun now ships a built-in image processing API that handles JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, and BMP — plus HEIC, AVIF, and TIFF on macOS and Windows — with **zero native module installs**.

`Bun.Image` provides a chainable pipeline for decoding, transforming, and encoding images, designed as a drop-in alternative to sharp for common server-side image operations.

```
// Resize and convert a photo to WebP
await Bun.file("photo.jpg")
  .image()
  .resize(1024, 1024, { fit: "inside" })
  .rotate(90)
  .webp({ quality: 85 })
  .write("thumb.webp");

// Generate a thumbnail from an upload in a single expression
return new Response(new Bun.Image(upload).resize(200).jpeg());
```

### Input sources[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#input-sources)

`Bun.Image` accepts path strings, `ArrayBuffer`/`TypedArray` (zero-copy), `Blob`/`BunFile`/`S3File`, and `data:` URLs. You can also use `Bun.file("photo.jpg").image()` or `blob.image()` to start a pipeline.

### Chainable transforms[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#chainable-transforms)

The pipeline supports `.resize(w, h?, {filter, fit, withoutEnlargement})`, `.rotate(90|180|270)`, `.flip()`, `.flop()`, and `.modulate({brightness, saturation})`. Output format is set with `.jpeg()`, `.png()`, `.webp()`, `.heic()`, or `.avif()` — each with format-specific quality/compression options.

### Resize filters[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#resize-filters)

All sharp filters are supported: `nearest`, `box`, `bilinear`, `cubic`, `mitchell`, `lanczos2`, `lanczos3`, plus `mks2013` and `mks2021`.

### Terminal methods[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#terminal-methods)

All processing runs off the main thread (except `metadata()`). Output via `.bytes()`, `.buffer()`, `.blob()`, `.toBase64()`, `.dataurl()`, `.placeholder()` (thumbhash), `.metadata()`, or `.write(dest)`.

```
const meta = await new Bun.Image(buf).metadata();
// { width: 1920, height: 1080, format: "jpeg", ... }

const placeholder = await Bun.file("hero.jpg").image().placeholder(); // thumbhash data URL for blur-up
```

### Body integration[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#body-integration)

`Bun.Image` instances work directly as response/request bodies with automatic `Content-Type`:

`return new Response(new Bun.Image(upload).resize(200).jpeg());`

### Platform-specific formats[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#platform-specific-formats)

| Format | macOS | Windows | Linux |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| JPEG | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| PNG | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| WebP | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| GIF | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| BMP (simple) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| TIFF | ✅ decode | ✅ decode | — |
| HEIC | ✅ decode + encode | ✅ decode + encode | — |
| AVIF | ✅ decode (+ encode on Apple Silicon) | ✅ decode + encode | — |

JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, and BMP use statically linked codecs and produce identical output across all platforms. HEIC, AVIF, and TIFF use OS system backends (ImageIO + vImage on macOS, WIC on Windows) with lazy symbol resolution for zero startup cost.

### Performance vs sharp 0.34.5[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#performance-vs-sharp-0-34-5)

Benchmarked on linux/x64 with 50 iterations and `sharp.concurrency(1)`:

| Operation | Bun.Image | sharp | Speedup |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `metadata()` | 0.004 ms | 0.28 ms | **70×** |
| 1080p PNG → 400×400 → JPEG | 28.6 ms | 39.5 ms | **1.38×** |
| 1080p PNG → 800×600 → WebP | 82.7 ms | 110.1 ms | **1.33×** |
| 4K JPEG → 800×450 → JPEG | 35.8 ms | 45.5 ms | **1.27×** |
| 4K JPEG → 1920×1080 → JPEG | 57.2 ms | 69.9 ms | **1.22×** |
| 12MP JPEG → 1024×768 → WebP | 138 ms | 165 ms | **1.20×** |

The performance comes from i16 fixed-point SIMD resize kernels, JPEG IDCT scaling to the smallest sufficient size, zero-copy ArrayBuffer borrowing, and a single pre-allocated arena for resize scratch memory.

## Global Virtual Store[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#global-virtual-store)

`bun install --linker=isolated` now supports a shared global virtual store via the `install.globalStore = true` option in `bunfig.toml`. Instead of cloning every package from the cache into each project's `node_modules` on every install, packages are materialized **once** into a global `<cache>/links/` directory, and each project's `node_modules/.bun/<pkg>@<ver>` becomes a symlink into it.

Warm installs — lockfile present, cache warm, `node_modules` wiped (the common CI path) — now perform ~1 `symlink()` per package instead of ~1 `clonefileat()` per file copy. On macOS APFS, `clonefileat()` holds a volume-wide kernel lock that made parallelization ineffective. The global store eliminates those calls entirely on the warm path.

**Benchmarks** — warm install of a ~1,400-package fixture on Apple Silicon macOS (`hyperfine --warmup 3 --runs 10`):

|  | Wall time | System time | `clonefileat` calls |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--linker hoisted` | 823 ms | 478 ms | 1,387 |
| `--linker isolated` (before) | 841 ms | 1,256 ms | 1,387 |
| **`--linker isolated` (after)** | **115 ms** | **94 ms** | **0** |

This is still experimental, so the global store is **off by default** with the isolated linker.

To enable:

```
# bunfig.toml
[install]
globalStore = true
```

Or via environment variable:

`BUN_INSTALL_GLOBAL_STORE=1 bun install`

A package is eligible for the global store only when it comes from an immutable cache source (npm registry, git, tarball — unpatched, no trusted lifecycle scripts) and all of its transitive dependencies are also eligible. Ineligible packages fall back to per-project copies automatically.

The entry hash encodes the package's resolved dependency closure, so two projects that resolve a package to the same transitive versions share one on-disk entry, while a project with different resolutions gets its own.

This release also fixes a pre-existing issue: Bun now synthesizes an implicit `"*"` optional peer dependency for entries that appear in `peerDependenciesMeta` but not in `peerDependencies` (matching pnpm/yarn behavior). This fixes compatibility with packages like `webpack-cli`.

## HTTP/3 (QUIC) support in `Bun.serve`[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#http-3-quic-support-in-bun-serve)

⚠️ **Highly experimental.** HTTP/3 support is new and likely has bugs. Do not deploy `http3: true` to production yet.

`Bun.serve` now supports HTTP/3 over QUIC. Enable it with a single flag:

```
Bun.serve({
  port: 443,
  tls: { cert, key },
  http3: true, // also listen on UDP/443 for HTTP/3
  fetch(req) {
    return new Response("hi");
  },
});
```

When `http3: true` is set alongside `tls`, Bun binds **TCP** for HTTP/1.1+2 and **UDP** for HTTP/3 on the same port. Your existing `fetch` handler and `routes` work identically across all three protocols — no code changes needed. HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 responses automatically include `Alt-Svc: h3=":<port>"; ma=86400` so browsers discover the QUIC endpoint.

You can also serve HTTP/3 only:

```
Bun.serve({
  port: 443,
  tls: { cert, key },
  http3: true,
  http1: false, // disable HTTP/1.1
  fetch(req) {
    return new Response("h3 only");
  },
});
```

Everything you'd expect works over HTTP/3: `new Response(readableStream)` for streaming, `new Response(Bun.file("large.bin"))`, `new Response(req.body)` passthrough, `req.url`/`req.headers`/`req.method` across `await` boundaries, `requestIP()`, `server.reload()`, and graceful `server.stop()`.

### Performance[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#performance)

On Linux x64 (single process, loopback), HTTP/3 is significantly faster than HTTPS/1.1 from the same server instance:

| Benchmark | HTTP/3 | HTTPS/1.1 | HTTP/1.1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Static route (`routes`) | **509,135 req/s** | 189,130 req/s | 239,476 req/s |
| Dynamic `fetch` handler | **283,485 req/s** | 142,323 req/s | 171,696 req/s |

~50% of HTTP/3 CPU time is inside lsquic; further optimizations may come in a future releas.e

### Limitations[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#limitations)

*   **WebSocket over HTTP/3** is not supported yet (`server.upgrade()` returns `false`). WebTransport is a separate project.
*   **0-RTT** is disabled.
*   `unix:` socket addresses skip the H3 listener (QUIC over Unix sockets is non-standard).
*   No trailer support, no `Expect: 100-continue` (matching HTTP/1.1 behavior).

## Experimental HTTP/2 Client for `fetch()`[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#experimental-http-2-client-for-fetch)

`fetch()` now supports HTTP/2 as an experimental feature. When enabled, Bun negotiates `h2` via TLS ALPN — multiple concurrent fetches to the same origin share a single multiplexed TCP+TLS connection instead of opening separate HTTP/1.1 connections.

Enable it globally with an environment variable or CLI flag, or opt in per-request:

```
// Opt in globally:
//   BUN_FEATURE_FLAG_EXPERIMENTAL_HTTP2_CLIENT=1 bun run app.js
//   bun run --experimental-http2-fetch app.js

// Or per-request (works without the env flag):
const res = await fetch("https://example.com", { protocol: "http2" });
```

### Multiplexing & connection coalescing[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#multiplexing-connection-coalescing)

Parallel fetches to the same origin share one TLS handshake and one connection. The first request opens the socket; subsequent requests attach to the same HTTP/2 session up to the server's `MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS` limit, with overflow queued automatically.

### Per-request protocol control[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#per-request-protocol-control)

The new `protocol` option in `RequestInit` lets you pin the HTTP version:

```
// Force HTTP/2 — fails with HTTP2Unsupported if the server doesn't support it
await fetch("https://example.com", { protocol: "http2" });

// Force HTTP/1.1 — ignores the experimental flag
await fetch("https://example.com", { protocol: "http1.1" });
```

Accepted values: `"http2"`, `"h2"`, `"http1.1"`, `"h1"`.

### What works[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#what-works)

*   **Keep-alive pooling** — idle HTTP/2 sessions (with HPACK state) are reused by subsequent requests
*   **Streaming request bodies** — `ReadableStream` bodies are sent as DATA frames with proper flow control
*   **`REFUSED_STREAM` and graceful `GOAWAY`** — transparently retried (up to 5 attempts) for replayable bodies
*   **Content-Length enforcement** per RFC 9113 §8.1.1
*   **`Expect: 100-continue`** support

### Hardening[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#hardening)

The HTTP/2 client also includes RFC 9113 conformance and denial-of-service protections:

*   **CONTINUATION flood / HPACK bomb mitigation**: 256 KiB cap on both header-block accumulation and decoded header lists, advertised via `SETTINGS_MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE`.
*   **PING reflection attack mitigation**: 1 MiB cap on queued PING/SETTINGS-ACK control frames prevents unbounded memory growth from malicious servers.
*   The first server frame must be SETTINGS per RFC 9113 — connections that violate this are immediately terminated.
*   `RST_STREAM(NO_ERROR)` mid-body now correctly fails the request instead of silently truncating the response.
*   `REFUSED_STREAM` retries only when no data has been delivered to the caller.
*   Content-Length mismatches with actual DATA frame bytes are now detected and rejected.
*   Trailers without `END_STREAM` are now rejected per spec.
*   `GOAWAY` no longer drops already-completed streams.

### Not yet supported[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#not-yet-supported)

HTTP proxies/CONNECT tunneling, Unix sockets, server push, and cleartext HTTP/2 (h2c) are not yet supported. The HTTP/1.1 path is completely unchanged when the flag is off and `protocol` is not set.

## Experimental HTTP/3 Client for `fetch()`[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#experimental-http-3-client-for-fetch)

`fetch()` now supports an experimental HTTP/3 client using the `protocol` option. This uses an lsquic-backed QUIC transport that runs alongside the existing HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 paths.

⚠️ **Highly experimental.** This is an early preview — the API may change in future releases.

```
const res = await fetch("https://example.com/", { protocol: "http3" });
console.log(await res.text());
```

Both `"http3"` and `"h3"` are accepted as protocol values. The HTTP/3 client shares the same redirect, decompression, and response handling pipeline as HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, so existing `fetch()` behavior is preserved.

**What's supported:**

*   All standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD)
*   Request and response headers, JSON bodies, gzip compression
*   Redirects
*   Large request/response bodies (1 MB+ round-trips)
*   Concurrent multiplexed requests over a single QUIC connection
*   Connection pooling and sequential reuse
*   `ReadableStream` request body uploads
*   Full-duplex bidirectional streaming (server can respond while upload is still in progress)
*   `rejectUnauthorized` TLS option (defaults to `true`)
*   `AbortSignal` support

### Alt-Svc HTTP/3 upgrades[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#alt-svc-http-3-upgrades)

The HTTP/3 client can also automatically upgrade `fetch()` requests to HTTP/3 via the `Alt-Svc` header (RFC 7838). When a server advertises `Alt-Svc: h3` in an HTTPS response, subsequent requests to that origin are routed over QUIC instead of TCP.

This is opt-in while the HTTP/3 client matures. Enable it with the CLI flag or environment variable:

```
# CLI flag
bun --experimental-http3-fetch app.ts

# Environment variable
BUN_FEATURE_FLAG_EXPERIMENTAL_HTTP3_CLIENT=1 bun app.ts
```

```
// First request goes over TCP/TLS as usual
const res1 = await fetch("https://example.com/api");
// If the response includes `Alt-Svc: h3=":443"`,
// the next request to the same origin uses QUIC/HTTP-3
const res2 = await fetch("https://example.com/api");
```

The upgrade is transparent and per-origin — cross-origin redirects re-evaluate from HTTP/1.1, and requests that aren't eligible (proxied, unix socket, `sendfile`, or pinned to a specific protocol) gracefully fall back to TCP.

## Rewritten `fs.watch()` backend on Linux, macOS, and FreeBSD[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#rewritten-fs-watch-backend-on-linux-macos-and-freebsd)

Bun's `fs.watch()` implementation on POSIX platforms has been completely rewritten to talk directly to the OS file-watching APIs (inotify, FSEvents, kqueue) instead of routing through Bun's internal bundler watcher. This fixes several long-standing bugs and reduces complexity significantly.

### Recursive watching now tracks new directories (Linux)[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#recursive-watching-now-tracks-new-directories-linux)

Previously, `fs.watch("dir", { recursive: true })` only registered the directory tree that existed at the time `watch()` was called. Directories created _after_ the watch started were never tracked, so files inside them were invisible to the watcher.

```
import fs from "node:fs";

// Now correctly detects changes inside directories created after watch() starts
fs.watch("./src", { recursive: true }, (event, filename) => {
  console.log(event, filename);
});

// mkdir src/newDir && touch src/newDir/file.txt
// Previously: only "rename newDir" — file.txt was missed
// Now: "rename newDir", "rename newDir/file.txt", "change newDir/file.txt"
```

### Deleted-and-recreated files emit `change` events again (Linux)[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#deleted-and-recreated-files-emit-change-events-again-linux)

When a watched file was deleted and recreated, subsequent modifications to the recreated file would silently stop emitting `change` events. This is now fixed — the new inotify watch descriptor is correctly registered on recreation.

### macOS no longer spins up two watcher threads[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#macos-no-longer-spins-up-two-watcher-threads)

Previously, `fs.watch()` on a directory on macOS would start _both_ a kqueue watcher (via the bundler watcher) and an FSEvents `CFRunLoop` thread. The new implementation uses FSEvents exclusively for both files and directories, matching libuv's behavior and halving the thread overhead.

## `--no-orphans` — exit when the parent process dies[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#no-orphans-exit-when-the-parent-process-dies)

Bun now supports an opt-in mode that automatically exits when its parent process dies — even if the parent was `SIGKILL`ed and never had a chance to forward a signal. On exit, Bun also recursively `SIGKILL`s every descendant process it spawned.

This is useful when Bun is launched by a supervisor (Electron, a CI runner, a thin shim) that may be force-killed. Without this option, Bun would be silently reparented to `launchd`/`init` and keep running forever, along with anything it spawned.

There are three equivalent ways to enable it:

```
# CLI flag (new)
bun --no-orphans run my-script

# bunfig.toml
[run]
noOrphans = true

# Environment variable
BUN_FEATURE_FLAG_NO_ORPHANS=1 bun run my-script
```

The flag is automatically inherited by nested Bun processes, so enabling it once at the top level is sufficient.

**How it works:**

*   **Linux**: Uses `prctl(PR_SET_PDEATHSIG, SIGKILL)` — kernel-delivered, no polling, no thread. Children spawned from the main thread also inherit `PDEATHSIG` by default so non-Bun descendants are covered.
*   **macOS**: Registers a `EVFILT_PROC`/`NOTE_EXIT` watch for the original parent pid on the existing event loop's kqueue — the same mechanism Bun already uses to watch child process exits. No dedicated thread, no extra file descriptor.

On clean exit, Bun walks its process tree and uses a **stop-verify-kill** strategy for pid-reuse safety: each descendant is `SIGSTOP`ped, its ppid is re-verified, and only then is it `SIGKILL`ed. This prevents accidentally killing an unrelated process that recycled a stale pid.

**macOS coverage is now comprehensive.** Previously, `bun run <script>` and `bunx` on macOS had no parent-death watching — if the parent was killed, spawned scripts could be left orphaned. Bun now uses a dedicated `kqueue` watcher for these paths, monitoring both the parent process and child stdio. `bun run --filter` and `bun run --parallel` on macOS are also now covered.

|  | Linux | macOS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bun <file>` | ✅ `prctl` | ✅ Event loop watcher |
| `bun run` / `bunx` | ✅ `prctl` | ✅ `kqueue` watcher (new) |
| `--filter` / `--parallel` | ✅ `prctl` | ✅ MiniEventLoop watcher (new) |

Linux and macOS only (no-op on Windows).

## `process.execve()` support[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#process-execve-support)

Bun now implements [`process.execve(execPath, args, env)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html), matching the API added in Node.js v24. This POSIX syscall replaces the current process image in-place — it never returns on success.

```
// Replace the current process with a new one
process.execve("/usr/bin/echo", ["echo", "hello from execve"], {
  PATH: process.env.PATH,
});

// ^ If successful, this line is never reached
```

Key details:

*   **stdio is inherited** — file descriptors 0/1/2 are preserved across the exec boundary, while all other descriptors are marked close-on-exec to prevent leaks.
*   **Signal mask is reset** before calling `execve(2)`.
*   Throws `ERR_WORKER_UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION` when called from a worker thread.
*   Throws `ERR_FEATURE_UNAVAILABLE_ON_PLATFORM` on Windows.
*   Emits an `ExperimentalWarning` once per process, matching Node.js behavior.
*   If `execve` fails, the process prints the error to stderr and aborts (consistent with Node.js behavior, since process state has already been mutated).

## `Bun.Terminal` on Windows via ConPTY[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#bun-terminal-on-windows-via-conpty)

`Bun.Terminal` and `Bun.spawn({ terminal })` now work on Windows, powered by the Windows [ConPTY](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/creating-a-pseudoconsole-session) API (`CreatePseudoConsole`). Previously, `Bun.Terminal` was only available on macOS and Linux.

```
const terminal = new Bun.Terminal({
  cols: 80,
  rows: 24,
  onData(data) {
    process.stdout.write(data);
  },
});

const proc = Bun.spawn({
  cmd: ["cmd.exe", "/c", "echo", "hello from ConPTY"],
  terminal,
});

await proc.exited;
terminal.close();
```

### Platform differences[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#platform-differences)

The core behavior — child sees a TTY, `write()` reaches the child's stdin, child output reaches the `data` callback, `resize()` updates the child's window size — is the same on every platform. A few details differ on Windows:

*   **No termios on Windows.**`inputFlags`, `outputFlags`, `localFlags`, and `controlFlags` always read as `0` and setting them is a no-op.
*   **No echo without a child process.** On POSIX, the kernel line discipline echoes `write()` input back to the `data` callback even with no process attached. ConPTY has no line discipline, so input is buffered for the next reader.
*   **ConPTY re-encodes output.** The `data` callback receives semantically equivalent — but not byte-identical — escape sequences compared to what the child emitted. Colors and text are preserved; cursor-positioning sequences may be reordered or coalesced.

## `using` / `await using` no longer lowered when targeting Bun[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#using-await-using-no-longer-lowered-when-targeting-bun)

Bun's underlying JavaScript engine (JavaScriptCore) natively supports the [Explicit Resource Management proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-explicit-resource-management) (`using` and `await using`). Starting in this release, Bun no longer transpiles these declarations into `__using` / `__callDispose` helper calls wrapped in `try`/`catch`/`finally` when the target is Bun.

This applies to:

*   `bun run` / `bun <file>`
*   `Bun.Transpiler({ target: "bun" })`
*   `bun build --target=bun` (including `--compile` and `--bytecode`)

Other targets (`browser`, `node`) continue to lower `using` as before.

**Before:**

```
// bun build --target=bun entry.js
var __using = (stack, value, async) => {
  /* ... */
};
var __callDispose = (stack, error, hasError) => {
  /* ... */
};
{
  let __stack = [];
  try {
    const x = __using(
      __stack,
      {
        [Symbol.dispose]() {
          /* ... */
        },
      },
      0,
    );
    console.log("hi");
  } catch (_catch) {
    var _err = _catch,
      _hasErr = 1;
  } finally {
    __callDispose(__stack, _err, _hasErr);
  }
}
```

**After:**

```
// bun build --target=bun entry.js
{
  using x = {
    [Symbol.dispose]() {
      /* ... */
    },
  };
  console.log("hi");
}
```

This also fixes a bug where `using` inside a CommonJS module (`.cjs`) would inject an ESM `import … from "bun:wrap"` inside the CommonJS function wrapper, causing an `Expected CommonJS module to have a function wrapper` error instead of the expected `TypeError` for non-disposable values.

## `SIGHUP` and `SIGBREAK` signal handling on Windows[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#sighup-and-sigbreak-signal-handling-on-windows)

`process.on('SIGHUP', …)` and `process.on('SIGBREAK', …)` now correctly receive Windows console-control events, matching Node.js behavior:

| Console event | Signal |
| --- | --- |
| `CTRL_CLOSE_EVENT` (closing the console window) | `SIGHUP` |
| `CTRL_BREAK_EVENT` (Ctrl+Break) | `SIGBREAK` |

Previously, these signal names were missing from Bun's Windows signal map, so registering a listener was treated as a plain `EventEmitter` event — no `uv_signal_t` was created, and the default handler would terminate the process immediately.

```
// Gracefully handle console window close on Windows
process.on("SIGHUP", () => {
  cleanup();
  process.exit();
});

// Handle Ctrl+Break
process.on("SIGBREAK", () => {
  console.log("Ctrl+Break received");
  process.exit();
});
```

Thanks to @ig-ant for the contribution!

## WebSocket `perMessageDeflate: false` now respected in upgrade requests[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#websocket-permessagedeflate-false-now-respected-in-upgrade-requests)

Previously, setting `perMessageDeflate: false` when creating a WebSocket connection was silently ignored — Bun always sent the `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: permessage-deflate; client_max_window_bits` header in the upgrade request. This broke deployments where gateways or proxies reject upgrade requests that advertise unwanted extensions.

Now, passing `perMessageDeflate: false` correctly suppresses the extension header, matching the behavior of Node.js and the `ws` package.

```
const WebSocket = require("ws");

// Extension header is now correctly omitted
const ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:3000", {
  perMessageDeflate: false,
});

// Also works with globalThis.WebSocket
const ws2 = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:3000", {
  perMessageDeflate: false,
});
```

Additionally, if the server responds with a `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header when the client did not offer any extensions, the handshake is now correctly failed per RFC 6455 §9.1 — matching upstream `ws` behavior.

## FreeBSD and Android Support[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#freebsd-and-android-support)

Bun now has 1st-party native builds for FreeBSD and Android.

## Reduced memory usage for MongoDB & Mongoose[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#reduced-memory-usage-for-mongodb-mongoose)

All TLS-using APIs in Bun — `Bun.connect`, `Bun.SQL` (Postgres & MySQL), Valkey, `upgradeTLS`, `new WebSocket()`, and `node:tls` — now share a single native `SSL_CTX` cache per VM. Connections with identical TLS configurations reuse the same `SSL_CTX` instead of allocating a fresh one (~50 KB of BoringSSL state + cert/key parsing) per connection.

This is especially impactful for database connection pools: a Postgres or MySQL pool with `sslmode=require` and N connections previously created N separate `SSL_CTX` objects. Now it creates one.

```
import { SQL } from "bun";

// All connections in this pool now share a single SSL_CTX
const db = new SQL("postgres://user:pass@host/db?sslmode=require");

// These also share the same cached SSL_CTX since the config is identical
const conn1 = await Bun.connect({
  hostname: "example.com",
  port: 443,
  tls: true,
  socket: {
    /* ... */
  },
});
const conn2 = await Bun.connect({
  hostname: "example.com",
  port: 443,
  tls: true,
  socket: {
    /* ... */
  },
});
```

The cache is keyed by a SHA-256 digest of the TLS configuration fields. `servername` and `ALPNProtocols` are excluded from the digest (they're per-connection, not per-context), so `Bun.connect({ tls: { servername: "x" } })` correctly shares the default `SSL_CTX` with `tls: true`.

This was the root cause behind long-standing memory leak reports when using `tls.connect()`, `Bun.connect({tls})`, `socket.upgradeTLS()`, and any library built on top of them (MongoDB, Mongoose, mysql2, etc.). Under connection churn — Postgres pools, Redis, fetch keepalive expiry, MongoDB heartbeats — RSS would grow rapidly until the garbage collector eventually frees the context. Now it avoids allocating unnecessary duplicate contexts.

```
// Before: each iteration allocated a fresh SSL_CTX (~50 KB+)
for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
  const sock = tls.connect({
    host: "localhost",
    port: 5432,
    rejectUnauthorized: false,
  });
  sock.on("secureConnect", () => sock.destroy());
}
// RSS after: ~1 GB

// After: one shared SSL_CTX, RSS stays flat
// RSS after: ~168 MB
```

Thanks to @sosukesuzuki for the upgrade!

Previously, `bun publish` included `README.md` in the published tarball but didn't populate the `readme` or `readmeFilename` fields in the JSON body sent to the npm registry. This meant packages published with Bun showed an empty README when queried via the registry API (e.g. `npm view <pkg> readme`), even though the tarball contained one.

Now, `bun publish` matches `npm publish` behavior by automatically finding the first `README` or `README.*` file (case-insensitive) in your workspace and including its contents in the version metadata sent to the registry. This works for both workspace publishes (`bun publish`) and tarball publishes (`bun publish path.tgz`). A `readme` field already present in `package.json` takes precedence.

```
# Before: registry API returned empty readme
npm view @my-scope/my-package readme  # ""

# After: readme contents are properly sent
npm view @my-scope/my-package readme  # "# my-package\n\nA great package..."
```

## Updated SQLite to 3.53.0[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#updated-sqlite-to-3-53-0)

Bun's built-in SQLite has been updated from 3.51.2 to [3.53.0](https://sqlite.org/src/vdiff?from=3.51.2&to=3.53.0).

Notable changes in SQLite 3.53.0 include:

*   New `SQLITE_DBCONFIG_FP_DIGITS` option for controlling floating-point precision when converting doubles to text
*   New `SQLITE_LIMIT_PARSER_DEPTH` limit for controlling the maximum depth of the SQL parser stack
*   New `SQLITE_PREPARE_FROM_DDL` flag for enforcing schema-level security constraints during statement preparation

## Cross-language LTO for Zig ↔ C++ on Linux[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#cross-language-lto-for-zig-c-on-linux)

Bun's binary is now built with full link-time optimization (LTO) across the Zig and C++ boundaries on Linux. Previously, the Zig-compiled object file was a native ELF object that the linker could link but not optimize across — meaning hundreds of small cross-language function calls (Zig → C++, C → Zig, allocator calls) were never inlined.

By emitting the Zig object as LLVM bitcode and participating in the same LTO link pass as the C/C++ side, LLVM can now inline and optimize across language boundaries:

| Boundary | Functions declared | Functions eliminated by inlining | % |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Zig `export fn` → C++ | 336 | 142 | 42% |
| C `us_*` (µSockets) ← Zig | 115 | 79 | 69% |
| C++ `uws_*` (µWebSockets) ← Zig | 108 | 76 | 70% |
| `mi_free` (mimalloc) | — | all | 100% |

**Measured impact (linux-x64):**

| Benchmark | Before | After | Improvement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Bun.escapeHTML` | 183.2 ns | 171.3 ns | **6.5% faster** |
| `TextDecoder.decode` | 106.8 ns | 104.0 ns | **2.6% faster** |
| HTTP throughput (`oha -n 1M -c 50`) | ~193,800 req/s | ~200,600 req/s | **3.5% faster** |

This is a broad improvement — any hot path that crosses the Zig/C++ boundary benefits, including HTTP serving, text encoding/decoding, and HTML escaping.

## Faster ESM module loading[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#faster-esm-module-loading)

Fixed an internal parser oversight where an ~8KB struct was being copied by value on every AST node allocation, causing unnecessary `memcpy` overhead during transpilation. Passing it by pointer instead eliminates the redundant copies, reducing `_platform_memmove` overhead from 7.5% to 2.9% of self time in profiling.

On a benchmark loading 500 ESM files, this results in approximately **12% faster** module loading (~140ms → ~123ms).

Thanks to @sosukesuzuki for the contribution!

## Reduced GC overhead for built-in objects[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#reduced-gc-overhead-for-built-in-objects)

Bun's incremental garbage collector previously re-scanned ~63 types of built-in objects (`Request`, `Response`, `Subprocess`, `Stats`, `Dirent`, `Timeout`, and more) after every mutator yield during incremental GC — even though these objects already use write barriers that guarantee correctness without the extra pass.

This redundant work has been removed. Only `visitChildren` is called now for codegen'd classes, eliminating the overhead of re-walking every live instance of these common types during incremental GC cycles. Hand-written types that genuinely require output constraints (like `EventTarget`, `AbortSignal`, `MessagePort`, etc.) are unchanged.

This should reduce GC pause times, especially in applications with many live built-in objects.

## Smaller binary size[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#smaller-binary-size)

Bun gets smaller on Windows and Linux. macOS binary size hasn't changed much.

| Target |  |
| --- | --- |
| Linux aarch64 | -9.07 MB |
| Linux aarch64-musl | -7.63 MB |
| Linux x64 | -8.58 MB |
| Linux x64-baseline | -8.64 MB |
| Linux x64-musl | -6.61 MB |
| Linux x64-musl-baseline | -6.75 MB |
| Windows aarch64 | -18.42 MB |
| Windows x64 | -17.66 MB |
| Windows x64-baseline | -17.67 MB |

## `tls.getCACertificates('system')` now works without `--use-system-ca`[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#tls-getcacertificates-system-now-works-without-use-system-ca)

Previously, `tls.getCACertificates('system')` returned an empty array `[]` unless `--use-system-ca` or `NODE_USE_SYSTEM_CA=1` was explicitly set. Node.js returns the OS trust store unconditionally for `'system'` — the flag only affects `'default'`. Bun now matches this behavior.

System certificates are lazy-loaded on first demand, so there's no startup cost unless `'system'` is actually queried or `--use-system-ca` is set.

```
import tls from "node:tls";

// Previously returned [] without --use-system-ca, now returns system CA certs
const systemCerts = tls.getCACertificates("system");
console.log(systemCerts.length); // > 0 on Linux/Windows
```

This also fixes a data race that could cause segfaults or truncated certificate lists when multiple threads (e.g. Workers) accessed root certificates concurrently during initialization.

Thanks to @cirospaciari for the contribution!

## `tls.getCACertificates('system')` no longer stalls on managed Macs[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#tls-getcacertificates-system-no-longer-stalls-on-managed-macs)

On macOS, `tls.getCACertificates('system')` previously evaluated every keychain certificate using `SecTrustEvaluateWithError` with an SSL policy, causing `trustd` to attempt OCSP/CRL/AIA network fetches for each cert. On managed Macs running a NetworkExtension content filter, this turned a local lookup into **~10 seconds of wall-clock time** as hundreds of outbound flows were individually signed and policy-denied by the filter.

This release rewrites the macOS keychain enumeration to match how Node.js and Chromium handle it:

*   **Removed `kSecMatchTrustedOnly` from the keychain query** — this flag forced a redundant network-revocation-enabled evaluation of every cert before per-cert filtering even started.
*   **Replaced the trust-settings stub with a full parser** — the previous implementation always returned `UNSPECIFIED`, causing every cert to fall through to the expensive `SecTrustEvaluateWithError` path. The new parser (ported from Node's `IsTrustSettingsTrustedForPolicy`) resolves certs via cheap local XPC lookups.
*   **Deferred `SecTrustEvaluateWithError` as a last resort** — only certs with no decisive trust settings in any domain reach it, and when they do, it now uses `SecPolicyCreateBasicX509` + `SecTrustSetNetworkFetchAllowed(false)` to avoid network access entirely.

The result is functionally equivalent — OpenSSL still enforces EKU and basic-constraint checks at handshake time — but enumeration no longer triggers any network I/O.

When using `--use-system-ca` or `NODE_USE_SYSTEM_CA=1` on Windows, Bun now reads from the same certificate stores as Node.js, fixing `unable to get local issuer certificate` errors commonly seen in enterprise and intranet environments.

Previously, Bun only enumerated the `ROOT` store for `CURRENT_USER` and `LOCAL_MACHINE`. This meant that when a server only sent a leaf certificate without its intermediates (very common on intranets with corporate proxies or self-signed certificates), Bun couldn't build the certificate chain — even though Windows had the intermediates cached in its `CA` store.

Bun now mirrors Node.js's `ReadWindowsCertificates` behavior:

|  | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Store names | `ROOT` | `ROOT`, `CA`, `TrustedPeople` |
| Locations | `LOCAL_MACHINE`, `CURRENT_USER` | + `GROUP_POLICY`, `ENTERPRISE` variants |
| `CERT_STORE_OPEN_EXISTING_FLAG` | ✗ | ✓ (don't create missing stores) |
| EKU server-auth filter | ✗ | ✓ (skip certs restricted to e.g. code-signing only) |

This brings `--use-system-ca` on Windows to parity with Node.js, making it significantly more reliable for enterprise environments with custom certificate authorities and proxy servers.

## Event loop refactor[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#event-loop-refactor)

Large parts of the event loop have been refactored to improve reliability and simplify memory management.

Along the way, this fixed:

*   `DuplexUpgradeContext` was never freed (full leak per `tls.connect({socket: duplex})`)
*   `UpgradedDuplex.onEndCallback` was incorrectly wired to `onReceivedData`
*   `SSLWrapper.init` leaked the strdup'd passphrase on error paths
*   `TLSSocket.memoryCost` now correctly reports off-heap SSL state

## Bugfixes[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#bugfixes)

### Node.js compatibility improvements[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#node-js-compatibility-improvements)

*   Fixed: memory leak in `node:http` where `NodeHTTPResponse` and its associated buffers were never freed when `ondata` was re-registered after the request body had already been fully received, also causing the event loop to stay alive unnecessarily
*   Fixed: `res.setTimeout()` on client-side `IncomingMessage` no longer keeps the event loop alive after the response completes. Previously, calling `res.setTimeout(90000)` would prevent the process from exiting for the full timeout duration, even when there was nothing left to do. The timer is now unref'd to match Node.js behavior. Also fixed `res.setTimeout()` to return `this`, clear the timer when called with `0`, and stack listeners via `res.on("timeout", cb)` for Node.js compatibility.
*   Fixed: use-after-free crash in HTTPS requests when `checkServerIdentity` rejects a certificate due to hostname mismatch
*   Fixed: `checkServerIdentity` callback passed to `https.request()` was ignored — the native check always ran instead
*   Fixed: `https.createServer()` with a `ca` option incorrectly required client certificates, even when `requestCert` was not set to `true`
*   Fixed: TLS certificate identity verification now falls back to the Subject Common Name (CN) when the certificate has no SAN entries, matching Node.js behavior
*   Fixed: use-after-free crash in `node:zlib` when an `onerror` callback issued a re-entrant `write()` followed by `close()` on native zlib/brotli/zstd handles
*   Fixed: heap-use-after-free crash in `node:zlib` when calling `.reset()` on a zlib, Brotli, or Zstd stream while an async `.write()` is still in progress on the threadpool
*   Fixed: memory leak in `crypto.scrypt` where the callback and protected password/salt buffers were never released when the output buffer allocation failed (e.g. with an extremely large `keylen`)
*   Fixed: `crypto.randomFill` and `crypto.randomFillSync` bounds-checking bugs that could cause a heap overflow when `offset` exceeded 2²⁴ due to `f32` precision loss, and a unit mismatch that caused integer underflow or silent under-fill for multi-byte typed arrays (e.g. `Float64Array`) when using the 3-argument form
*   Fixed: `crypto.subtle.unwrapKey('jwk', ...)` promise never settling and leaking memory when the decrypted payload was valid JSON but not a valid JWK (e.g. missing the required `kty` field). The `TypeError` now correctly rejects the promise instead of escaping as an uncaught exception. Also fixed a smaller native memory leak when decrypted bytes weren't valid JSON at all.
*   Fixed: `process.dlopen` crash when a native addon's init callback re-entrantly calls `napi_module_register()` (e.g. nested `dlopen` or registering additional modules from within an init function), which could invalidate the internal iterator and cause a use-after-free
*   Fixed: `napi_create_external_arraybuffer` and `napi_create_external_buffer` now correctly return `napi_pending_exception` when a NAPI exception is already pending, matching Node.js behavior. Previously, calling these functions with a pending exception could lead to double-frees or orphaned GC cells with permanently-disarmed destructors.
*   Fixed: fuzzer-detected crash in `process.setgroups()` and `process.hrtime()` with unexpected input
*   Fixed: crash when lazy construction of `process.stdin`/`process.stdout`/`process.stderr` throws near the stack recursion limit and an `uncaughtException` listener is registered
*   Fixed: `process.stdin` hanging or spinning at 100% CPU when reading from a FIFO pipe and the parent process dies or a new writer reappears during the drain loop
*   Fixed: `process.stdin.isRaw` not updating after a successful `setRawMode()` call on Windows, which caused `readline` and other modules that check `isRaw` to incorrectly restore cooked mode
*   Fixed: out-of-bounds read in `Buffer.from()` with invalid input in a less common encoding
*   Fixed: `Buffer.copyBytesFrom()` producing incorrect results or throwing `RangeError: Out of memory` when called with a TypedArray view that has a non-zero `byteOffset` into its backing `ArrayBuffer`
*   Fixed: memory leak in `Buffer.from(string, 'hex')` and `Buffer.from(string, 'base64')` when the input contained no valid encoded characters (e.g. `Buffer.from('zz', 'hex')`). The internal staging allocation was never freed when decoding produced zero bytes, causing ~4KB to leak per call. Also fixed a related issue where `ffi.toBuffer(ptr, 0, finalizer)` would silently drop the user's finalizer.
*   Fixed: crash and out-of-bounds read in `Buffer#copy` and `Buffer#fill` when a `valueOf` callback detaches or resizes the underlying `ArrayBuffer` during argument coercion
*   Fixed: memory leak in `child_process` stdout when reading from spawned processes — the internal `FileReader.onPull` memcpy path failed to free the drained buffer, causing linear RSS growth under sustained reads
*   Fixed: memory leak in `tlsSocket.setSession()` where each call leaked one `SSL_SESSION` (~6.5 KB per call) due to a missing `SSL_SESSION_free` after `d2i_SSL_SESSION`
*   Fixed: crash when calling `TLSSocket.getServername()` after the socket was closed, due to a null SSL pointer dereference
*   Fixed: use-after-free in `tls.connect({socket: duplex})` when a pre-open duplex error races with the queued `StartTLS` task, causing freed `Handlers` memory to be read
*   Fixed: memory leaks in `getPeerCertificate()` on server-side TLS sockets (mTLS) where an X509 reference from `SSL_get_peer_certificate` was never freed and a BIO was leaked (~800 bytes per call) in `X509Certificate.raw` due to an incorrect destructor capture
*   Fixed: memory leak in `node:net` when `socket.connect()` fails synchronously on reused handles (e.g. connecting to a nonexistent Unix socket path), which leaked one native socket struct per failed reconnect
*   Fixed: memory leak where `fs.watch(path, { persistent: false })` watchers were never garbage collected after `.close()`, caused by a reference count underflow that permanently pinned each watcher as a GC root
*   Fixed: memory leak in `fs.watch()` on macOS where the resolved directory path was never freed, leaking ~path-length bytes on every `fs.watch(<directory>)` call
*   Fixed: a use-after-free race condition in `fs.watch` on macOS where closing a watcher while events were firing could crash due to the CoreFoundation thread reading freed memory
*   Fixed: a crash on macOS where `FSEventStreamCreate` could return `NULL` under rapid `fs.watch().close()` churn, causing a CoreServices crash when the `NULL` stream was passed to `FSEventStreamScheduleWithRunLoop`
*   Fixed a crash in `fs.readdirSync()` with `{ encoding: 'buffer', recursive: true }` when a subdirectory fails to open (e.g. due to a self-referential symlink causing `ELOOP`). An internal memory management bug caused a use-after-free in the error cleanup path, leading to crashes or corrupted results.
*   Fixed: memory leak in `fs.readdirSync()` with `{ recursive: true, withFileTypes: true }` when the call fails partway through (e.g. due to `ELOOP` or `EACCES`), where `Dirent.path` references were not properly released on the error path
*   Fixed: crash involving long file paths in `fs.cp`, `fs.promises.cp`, and `fs.cpSync` with `{ recursive: true }`
*   Fixed: `fs.cp` / `fs.cpSync` on Linux and FreeBSD copied symlinks with the source symlink's own path as the target instead of the path the symlink actually pointed at, causing copied symlinks to point back into the source tree and dangle if the source was deleted. Also fixed `cpSync` throwing `ENOENT` when copying a symlink to a destination whose parent directory doesn't exist.
*   Fixed: `fs.cp`/`fs.cpSync` on Windows leaking an OS handle for every symlink or junction in the source tree, which could exhaust the process handle table when copying large trees (e.g. `node_modules` with pnpm-style junctions)
*   Fixed: memory leak in `fs.symlinkSync`, `fs.linkSync`, and `fs.renameSync` where path arguments were not freed when a later argument was rejected, causing RSS to grow by hundreds of MB in error-heavy loops
*   Fixed: memory leak in `dns.lookup` and `dns.resolve*` when more than 32 concurrent c-ares DNS requests are in flight, where overflow results were never freed
*   Fixed: use-after-free crashes in `node:http2` when re-entrant JS callbacks (e.g. `session.request()` inside a timeout listener, an options getter, or a write callback) triggered a hashmap rehash, invalidating internal stream pointers. Streams are now heap-allocated and stable for the lifetime of the session. (@Jarred-Sumner)
*   Fixed: a crash in `node:vm` where `SourceTextModule.link()` with many imports could trigger a use-after-free when the garbage collector concurrently iterated the module's resolve cache during a HashMap rehash
*   Fixed: ESM module evaluation where sibling static imports could incorrectly skip waiting for async-pending strongly connected components, causing TDZ errors when accessing bindings from cyclic module graphs with top-level `await`
*   Fixed: deadlock when a non-entry module with top-level `await` dynamically imports a module that imports it back
*   Fixed: importing a module with top-level `await` from multiple sibling imports in the same module graph caused a `ReferenceError: Cannot access before initialization` because sibling modules skipped the spec-mandated wait for the shared TLA dependency to settle (@sosukesuzuki)
*   Fixed: `node:test` top-level `test()` ignoring `{ skip }` and `{ todo }` options — nested `Suite#test` honored them, but the top-level entry point did not
*   Fixed: child processes spawned by Bun on macOS could inherit an effectively infinite `RLIMIT_NOFILE` soft limit, causing programs that read the limit into an `int` to misbehave (e.g. failing socket reads). The startup file descriptor limit raise is now capped at `1 << 20`, matching Node.js. (@alii)

### Bun APIs[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#bun-apis)

*   Fixed: use-after-free when reading `.listener` on a closed client socket created via `Bun.connect()`
*   Fixed: use-after-free when accessing `handle.listener` on a socket that failed to connect, where the native socket's `handlers` pointer was left dangling after the per-connection `Handlers` allocation was freed
*   Fixed a crash when calling `socket.reload()` or `listener.reload()` on active TCP/TLS sockets. Previously, reloading handlers reset the internal active connection counter to zero, which caused integer overflow panics in debug builds and segfaults (heap-use-after-free) in release builds. This affected reloads both inside and outside of socket event handlers.
*   Fixed: crash (NULL dereference / SIGSEGV) when closing a socket inside a TLS 1.2 renegotiation handshake callback (`Bun.connect` with TLS)
*   Fixed: use-after-free in TLS server ALPN callback when handling concurrent handshakes, which could cause crashes or garbage data during protocol negotiation on servers with `ALPNProtocols` configured (@Jarred-Sumner)
*   Fixed: TLS sockets could leak memory and stay open indefinitely when `SSL_shutdown` failed to flush the `close_notify` alert (e.g. kernel buffer full or peer already gone), because the socket would wait for a peer event that never arrives. Now the socket closes immediately in this case. (@cirospaciari)
*   Fixed: use-after-free crash when calling `flush()` on a TLS socket after `end()`, where the deferred TLS close_notify handshake could dereference already-freed handler memory
*   Fixed: DNS resolution hanging indefinitely on macOS when retrying without `AI_ADDRCONFIG` on loopback-only network configurations. The retry path was polling the wrong mach port, causing `fetch()`, `Bun.connect()`, and other network APIs to hang instead of completing the DNS lookup.
*   Fixed: `Bun.dns.lookup()` with an oversized hostname could cause a crash
*   Fixed: DNS resolution over TCP could trigger an assertion failure when c-ares requested both readable and writable polling on the same socket file descriptor. `FilePoll` now correctly merges both directions into a single `epoll_ctl(CTL_MOD)` call on Linux, and properly submits two `EV_DELETE` changes on kqueue (macOS/FreeBSD) when both directions are registered. (@Jarred-Sumner)
*   Fixed: when using `Bun.spawn` with `stdin: "pipe"` without ever reading the `.stdin` property, the stdin pipe file descriptor would leak and remain open until the `Subprocess` was garbage collected — even after the child process had already exited. The stdin pipe fd is now properly closed when the child process exits.
*   Fixed: `Bun.spawn` incorrectly closing caller-owned file descriptors passed as extra `stdio` slots (index ≥ 3) after the subprocess was garbage collected, causing `EACCES`/`EBADF` errors on subsequent reuse of those descriptors (@cirospaciari)
*   Fixed: `Bun.spawn` returning `null` for `proc.stdio[N]` when a caller-supplied file descriptor was passed as extra stdio (index ≥ 3), instead of returning the fd number back. Caller-owned fds are now correctly exposed via `proc.stdio[N]` while still never being closed by the subprocess.
*   Fixed: `Bun.spawn` reading uninitialized memory when `stdio[N>=3]` is `undefined` or a sparse array hole, which could expose garbage file descriptors or crash by dereferencing invalid pointers in release builds
*   Fixed: memory leak where `Bun.spawn()` subprocess objects were never garbage collected when stdout/stderr pipes drained asynchronously after the child process exited (e.g. when a grandchild process inherited the pipe)
*   Fixed: `Bun.spawn({ ipc })` subprocesses were never garbage collected after the child exited, leaking the subprocess along with its stdout/stderr buffers, stdin FileSink, and other retained objects for the lifetime of the process
*   Fixed: memory leak in subprocess `PipeReader` when a stdout/stderr read failed with a real error (e.g. `EBADF`, `EIO`). The `PipeReader` struct, its buffered bytes, `FilePoll`, and pipe fd would all leak, and the leaked poll's keep-alive ref would prevent the event loop from ever exiting.
*   Fixed: subprocess `'exit'` event not firing on Linux when multiple child processes exit simultaneously with `stdio: 'ignore'`. On Linux, the pidfd poll was registered with `EPOLLONESHOT`, which caused the kernel to disarm the fd before user-space could process it if a nested event loop tick occurred. The pidfd is now registered as level-triggered so a dropped event is harmlessly re-delivered.
*   Fixed: 2 rare crashes in `Bun.serve()`
*   Fixed: memory leak in `Bun.serve()` when a direct `ReadableStream` handler writes synchronously without returning a promise — each such request leaked the internal response sink and its buffer (~400 bytes per request)
*   Fixed: GC root leak in `Bun.serve()` when a `"direct"` response stream rejects while a `controller.end()` or `controller.flush(true)` promise is pending due to transport backpressure
*   Fixed: heap-use-after-free and `RequestContext` leak when a chunked request body exceeds `maxRequestBodySize` and the fetch handler returns a pending Promise
*   Fixed: memory leak in `server.fetch(string)` where the intermediate URL buffer was leaked on every call
*   Fixed: `server.fetch()` crashing with a segfault when passed a `BigInt` argument, now properly rejects with a `TypeError`
*   Fixed: memory leak when calling `server.reload()` with a WebSocket config that lacks `open` or `message` handlers — discarded handler functions were permanently rooted and never garbage collected
*   Fixed: crash in `Bun.serve()` when `websocket.perMessageDeflate` was set to a non-boolean primitive (e.g. number, string, bigint, or symbol). Now throws a `TypeError` with a descriptive message instead.
*   Fixed: `Bun.serve` with `development: true` and a `[serve.static]` plugin whose `setup()` throws would cause requests to hang forever instead of returning an error
*   Fixed: rare crash in `server.upgrade()` when an option getter (e.g. `get data()`) mutates `req.headers` during the upgrade
*   Fixed: `server.upgrade()` crashing or firing the `open` handler twice when a user-defined getter on the `data` or `headers` option re-entrantly called `server.upgrade()` on the same request
*   Fixed: `Bun.FileSystemRouter` crashing with a panic when route filenames contained certain byte values
*   Fixed: memory leak in `Bun.FileSystemRouter` where accessing `.params` on a `MatchedRoute`
*   Fixed: rare `Bun.FileSystemRouter` use-after-free crash
*   Fixed: rare heap corruption in `Bun.file().json()`
*   Fixed: memory leak in `Bun.zstdDecompressSync` where the partial output buffer was not freed when streaming decompression failed (e.g. corrupt or truncated zstd frames), and a double-free when known-size fast-path decompression failed
*   Fixed: file descriptor leak in `Bun.Glob` when encountering `NAMETOOLONG` errors during directory traversal (@alii)
*   Fixed: `Bun.pathToFileURL()` crashing with an out-of-bounds panic when given a relative path that, when joined with cwd, exceeded 4096 bytes
*   Fixed: memory leak in `Bun.password.hash()` and `Bun.password.hashSync()` where the hash output buffer was not freed after being copied into a JavaScript string
*   Fixed: crash in `Bun.markdown.ansi()` when input contained invalid UTF-8 lead bytes (lone continuation bytes `0x80-0xBF` and bytes `0xF8-0xFF`) by treating them as replacement characters instead of passing them to the multibyte decoder
*   Fixed: `Bun.S3Client({ queueSize })` panicking when `queueSize` exceeded 255, and silently overriding any valid `queueSize` (1–255) to 255
*   Fixed: `Bun.s3.list()` panicking when `prefix`, `delimiter`, `continuationToken`, or `startAfter` exceeded ~341 characters after URL-encoding, since S3 keys can be up to 1024 bytes and percent-encoding can triple that size.
*   Fixed: `Bun.Archive.prototype.files()` memory leak when processing corrupted/truncated archives where previously-read entries were not freed on mid-stream `readData` failures
*   Fixed: `Bun.RedisClient` getting permanently stuck in a failed state after reconnection attempts were exhausted, `close()` was called, or a fatal socket error occurred. Previously, calling `client.connect()` would not recover the client. Now `connect()` properly resets internal state and replays the handshake, allowing the client to recover without replacing the instance.
*   Fixed: `RedisClient` TLS connections now properly verify hostnames against the server certificate when `rejectUnauthorized: true` is set. Previously, hostname mismatches and self-signed certificates were silently accepted due to unreachable verification code paths. Connections with mismatched hostnames now correctly reject with `ERR_TLS_CERT_ALTNAME_INVALID`, and untrusted certificates reject with the appropriate verification error.
*   Fixed: `FileSink` memory leak where native instances were never freed when a pending buffered write failed (e.g. `EPIPE` after the reader closes), causing the `FileSink`, its outgoing buffer, and associated refs to leak for the lifetime of the process
*   Fixed: memory leak when passing `Bun.file()` as `cert`, `key`, or `ca` in TLS options — each config parse leaked one buffer per file
*   Fixed: crash in `new Bun.Terminal()` when passing a non-object argument (e.g. a number, string, or boolean) instead of an options object
*   Fixed: `Bun.udpSocket()` leaked memory when creation failed (e.g. invalid port, bind failure, or throwing getter) because the internal strong reference prevented garbage collection of the wrapper object
*   Fixed: a use-after-free in `UDPSocket.send()` and `UDPSocket.sendMany()` where user code in `valueOf()` or `toString()` callbacks could detach an ArrayBuffer (via `.transfer()`) between payload capture and the actual send, causing reads from freed memory
*   Fixed: heap out-of-bounds write in `UDPSocket.sendMany()` when the socket's connection state changed mid-iteration via user JS callbacks (e.g. `valueOf()`, array index getters). This could cause memory corruption or crashes when `connect()` or `disconnect()` was called synchronously during a `sendMany()` call.
*   Fixed: `UDPSocket.setTTL()` and `UDPSocket.setMulticastTTL()` crashing with a null pointer dereference when the argument's `valueOf` closes the socket during coercion
*   Fixed: `import("bun:main")` was incorrectly resolved as the npm `main` package instead of the built-in `bun:main` module, due to a missing alias mapping in the runtime transpiler (@dylan-conway)
*   Fixed: use-after-free crash in `HTMLRewriter.transform()` when a document or element handler returns a rejected promise during the final `end()` chunk
*   Fixed: memory leak in `HTMLRewriter` where handler structs allocated by `.on()` and `.onDocument()` were never freed when the rewriter was garbage-collected, causing unbounded memory growth
*   Fixed: `HTMLRewriter` attribute iterators could read freed memory when saved outside an element handler callback — calling `.next()` on a leaked iterator now safely returns `{done: true}` instead of dereferencing a dangling pointer. Iterators are also correctly detached when `setAttribute` or `removeAttribute` mutates the underlying attribute buffer.

### `bun:sql`[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#bun-sql)

*   Fixed: `bun:sql` PostgreSQL connections that entered a `.failed` state (e.g. `ECONNREFUSED`, SSL refused with `sslmode=require`, or a normal `close()`) were never garbage collected, leaking the entire native connection including buffers, statements, and SSL state. The request queue's backing buffer was also not freed during cleanup.
*   Fixed: `sql.unsafe()` with multiple semicolon-separated statements in simple mode returned wrong column names for all result sets after the first, and leaked memory from previous field descriptors
*   Fixed: memory leak in `bun:sql` when querying PostgreSQL array-typed columns (`text[]`, `int8[]`, `json[]`, `bytea[]`, `bool[]`, etc.) that caused RSS to grow ~72 MB per 1,000 iterations instead of stabilizing after warmup
*   Fixed: a potential heap buffer overflow when parsing binary-format `int4[]`/`float4[]` arrays from a malicious or buggy PostgreSQL server. The server-provided `len` field is now validated against the actual column byte length before iterating, preventing out-of-bounds reads and writes.
*   Fixed: MySQL stored procedures called via prepared statements (tagged templates or `sql.unsafe(..., params)`) would resolve after only the first result set, causing the trailing OK packet to surface as an unhandled `TypeError` outside the caller's `catch` block
*   Fixed: heap buffer overflow in `sql` MySQL client when the user-supplied parameter array was mutated (e.g. via a side-effecting getter) between query preparation and binding, which could cause out-of-bounds writes in release builds
*   Fixed: MySQL `sql` client returning garbage error messages when a cached failed prepared statement was re-executed, caused by a dangling pointer into an overwritten socket read buffer
*   Fixed: MySQL `.raw()` returning length-prefix bytes in the buffer for length-encoded columns (JSON, VARCHAR, TEXT, BLOB, ENUM, SET, GEOMETRY, NEWDECIMAL), causing garbled output when decoded as UTF-8
*   Fixed: MySQL client could panic or silently read out-of-bounds memory when a server sent a short auth nonce during `AuthSwitchRequest` for `mysql_native_password`. The client now validates nonce length and rejects with `ERR_MYSQL_MISSING_AUTH_DATA` before accessing the buffer. Also fixed potential divide-by-zero with empty nonces for `caching_sha2_password` and invalid indexing with empty public key payloads.
*   Fixed: a use-after-free crash in `bun:sql` MySQL client when a prepared statement's column reallocation failed
*   Fixed: MySQL BLOB parameters could be corrupted when `ArrayBuffer.transfer()` or GC occurred during query parameter binding
*   Fixed: memory leak in MySQL adapter when using dynamic interpolation in SQL template literals
*   Fixed: a crash in `Bun.sql` MySQL client when a query's `.catch()` callback called `connection.close()`
*   Fixed: `SSL_CTX` leak in Postgres and MySQL connections when path coercion throws after SSL context creation
*   Fixed: `us_listen_socket_add_server_name` not propagating duplicate-hostname errors, preventing App.h's rollback from firing

### Web APIs[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#web-apis)

*   Fixed: `FormData` multipart boundary format now matches WebKit exactly (`----WebKitFormBoundary{hex}` with 4 leading dashes and capital `K`), fixing compatibility issues with downstream multipart parsers including OpenAI's API
*   Fixed: memory leak in `FormData` serialization when a `Bun.file()` entry fails to read (e.g. `ENOENT`). Previously, constructing a `Response` or `Request` from a `FormData` containing a valid `Bun.file()` followed by an invalid one would leak the already-read file buffers on each failed attempt.
*   Fixed: `TextDecoder.decode` reading through a stale pointer when an `options.stream` getter detaches or transfers the input `ArrayBuffer`, which could cause incorrect output, non-deterministic behavior, or crashes due to heap corruption
*   Fixed: memory leak in `TextDecoder` when decoding UTF-16LE and UTF-16BE encoded buffers. Each successful call to `.decode()` leaked the decoded output buffer.
*   Fixed: empty `Blob` and `File` objects incorrectly displaying as `[Blob detached]` / `[File detached]` in `console.log` and after `structuredClone`
*   Fixed: use-after-free in `Blob` when a duplicated blob's `content_type` was heap-allocated, causing `Response` headers to read freed memory and return garbage values (e.g. after `Bun.file(path, { type: "..." })` followed by `new Response(file)`)
*   Fixed: memory leak in structured-clone deserialization of Blob/File objects where truncated or malformed payloads would leak allocated buffers for `content_type`, bytes payload, `Store`, and heap `Blob` on error paths
*   Fixed: `structuredClone()` crash when serializing large `ArrayBuffer`, `SharedArrayBuffer`
*   Fixed: memory leak in `fetch()` when following long HTTP redirect chains
*   Fixed: memory leak when using `fetch()` with percent-encoded `data:` URLs, where the intermediate decoded buffer was never freed on each call
*   Fixed: `fetch()` silently hanging against certain hosts due to ECH GREASE being enabled in the TLS ClientHello. Some servers and middleboxes treated the `encrypted_client_hello` extension as hostile—completing the TLS handshake but never sending a response. This aligns Bun's `fetch` TLS behavior with `curl`, Node.js, and Bun's own `node:tls`.
*   Fixed: `WebSocket.close()` and `WebSocket.terminate()` called during the `CONNECTING` state would leave the socket permanently stuck in `CLOSING`, never fire `close`/`error` events, prevent the process from exiting, and leak the WebSocket instance. Now correctly transitions to `CLOSED`, fires `error` then `close` (code `1006`, `wasClean: false`) per the spec, and releases all internal references.
*   Fixed: memory leak in `WebSocket` when TLS options were provided but the connection failed during option parsing or validation
*   Fixed: memory leak where every `new WebSocket("wss://…")` routed through an HTTP CONNECT proxy (tunnel mode) leaked one internal `HTTPUpgradeClient` struct due to a missing reference count release
*   Fixed: per-connection memory leak when using WebSocket clients over `wss://` through an HTTP CONNECT proxy (tunnel mode). The internal I/O-layer reference was never released because the tunnel path doesn't adopt a uSockets socket, so the close handler never fired — leaking send/receive FIFOs, deflate state, and poll refs for every connection.
*   Fixed: a `TypeError [ERR_INVALID_STATE]: Controller is already closed` error thrown when streaming small files (e.g. `Bun.file(small).stream()`) where the first pull returns data and EOF simultaneously, causing the controller's `close()` to be called twice
*   Fixed: a race condition where concurrent `ReadableStream` instances (e.g. `process.stdin` and `fetch(file://...)` bodies) could close each other due to a shared mutable `closer` array at the class factory scope. This caused `stdin` to be spuriously closed, breaking subsequent operations like `setRawMode`.
*   Fixed: concurrent `ReadableStream` instances (e.g. `Bun.stdin.stream()` and `fetch(file://...)` bodies) could spuriously close each other due to a shared mutable EOF flag, causing `stdin` to close unexpectedly with `EBADF` errors
*   Fixed: `TransformStream` instances that were dropped without being explicitly closed, errored, or aborted were never garbage collected, causing an out-of-memory crash in long-running applications. A GC-root cycle between the global object's guarded objects set and the internal writable stream kept the entire stream graph permanently reachable.
*   Fixed: a long-lived `AbortSignal` reused across many `addEventListener`/`removeEventListener` cycles would accumulate dead closures in memory indefinitely. Each call to `addEventListener` with a `{ signal }` option registered an internal abort algorithm, but removing the listener (via `removeEventListener`, `{ once: true }` firing, or `removeAllEventListeners`) never cleaned up that algorithm — causing unbounded memory growth on the signal.
*   Fixed: A non-303 redirect with a `ReadableStream` body now correctly rejects with `TypeError` instead of `UnexpectedRedirect`.
*   Fixed: `AbortSignal.reason` is now properly forwarded to the request body's `ReadableStream.cancel(reason)`.

### Security[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#security)

*   Fixed: HTTP request smuggling attack vector
*   Fixed: missing bounds check in maliciously-crafted `Blob` deserialization
*   Fixed: integer overflow in IPC `advanced` serialization mode with malicious input

#### Worker fixes

*   Fixed: stack overflow crash when closing a deep chain of nested transferred `MessagePort`s
*   Fixed: `MessagePort` memory leak when workers are terminated without explicitly closing their ports. When `port.onmessage` was assigned or `port.ref()` was called inside a Worker, the internal self-reference was never released during worker teardown, causing every such `MessagePort` to leak for the lifetime of the process.
*   Fixed: a race condition crash in `MessageEvent` when using `BroadcastChannel` or `MessagePort` where the GC marker thread could observe a torn variant in `m_data` during concurrent access, causing a `SIGSEGV` in release builds
*   Fixed: segfault in `worker.getHeapSnapshot()` caused by a cross-thread race condition where the parent VM's `HandleSet` was mutated from the worker thread without holding the parent VM's lock
*   Fixed: memory leak and crash when terminating Workers that have a `PerformanceObserver` without calling `.disconnect()` — a reference cycle between `Performance` and `PerformanceObserver` prevented both objects from being freed
*   Fixed: IPC subprocess cleanup on Windows when `uv_read_start` fails after pipe open — the embedded `SendQueue` and its pending close task are now properly cancelled before the allocation is freed, preventing a use-after-free crash
*   Fixed: a crash on Linux (glibc) during Worker teardown caused by a stale `.eh_frame_hdr` section reference in the stripped release binary

### Timers[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#timers)

*   Fixed: native memory leak in `setTimeout` when `clearTimeout(t)`, `t.refresh()`, or `t._repeat = N` is called synchronously inside the timer's own callback. The native `TimeoutObject` struct was never freed because the post-callback cleanup only checked for the `.FIRED` state, missing transitions to `.CANCELLED` or `.ACTIVE` that occur when the timer is cleared, refreshed, or converted to an interval during execution.
*   Fixed: crash when calling `clearImmediate` on a `setImmediate` followed by garbage collection (`Bun.gc(true)`) — the cleared immediate's internal reference could panic during event loop cleanup if the GC had already finalized the JS wrapper
*   Fixed: `timer.ref()` on an already-fired `setTimeout` or `setImmediate` no longer incorrectly keeps the event loop alive, which previously caused the process to hang indefinitely
*   Fixed: `setTimeout` with an out-of-range delay no longer leaves a pending JS exception when the timeout overflow warning triggers user code that throws (e.g., a throwing getter on `process._exiting`), which previously caused crashes in debug builds and unexpected errors in release builds

### bun install[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#bun-install)

*   Fixed: `bun install` no longer hangs on stalled TLS handshakes and will instead timeout.
*   Fixed: `bunx @scope/name` no longer matches unrelated system binaries in `$PATH` When running scoped packages with `bunx`, the bin name was guessed by stripping the scope (e.g. `@uidotsh/install` → `install`), then searched against the full system `$PATH`. If the guessed name collided with an existing system binary like `/usr/bin/install`, `/usr/bin/git`, or `/usr/bin/find`, the system binary would be silently executed instead of the package's actual bin.
*   Fixed: `bun install --force` now correctly replaces corrupted entries in the global store instead of silently keeping the broken version
*   Fixed: `bun install` hanging indefinitely when a tarball download returns a 4xx/5xx HTTP error (e.g. `404 Not Found`) during the install phase, particularly when resolving from an existing lockfile with an empty cache. Both the hoisted and isolated linkers now fail fast with a clear error message instead of blocking forever. (@alii)
*   Fixed: `bun install` hanging indefinitely when a tarball integrity check fails with the isolated linker. When a tarball's SHA-512 didn't match the manifest (e.g. due to a registry redirect serving wrong content), the isolated installer would deadlock instead of reporting an error.
*   Fixed: a race condition in `bun install` where worker threads could read lockfile data (`packages`/`string_bytes`) that was simultaneously being reallocated by the main thread, potentially causing crashes or failed tarball resolution when installing workspaces with relative tarball paths
*   Fixed: `bun add` (and `remove`/`link`/`unlink`/`bunx`) crashing with a segfault when a positional argument exceeded 2048 bytes

### JavaScript bundler[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#javascript-bundler)

*   Fixed: a type confusion bug in the bundler plugin error handling that could cause a segfault when the plugin builtin threw synchronously
*   Fixed: memory leak in `Bun.build()` when using `sourcemap: 'inline'` without `outdir` — the intermediate sourcemap JSON buffer was not being freed after base64-encoding
*   Fixed a crash in `Bun.build()` and `Bun.Transpiler` when the `loader` or `define` options contained an empty-string key (e.g., `loader: { "": "js", ".ts": "ts" }`) that left uninitialized memory slots, causing a segfault when the entries were later hashed or freed
*   Fixed: `bun build --target=browser` panic involving long `"browser"` field paths
*   Fixed: crash reading `.referrer` on a `ResolveError` after the resolving frame had returned, particularly with non-ASCII source paths
*   Fixed: bundler leaving behind empty `else {}` blocks after dead code elimination when not using `--minify-syntax`
*   Fixed: crash with malicious input in `Bun.Transpiler().transformSync()`
*   Fixed: crash in `Bun.Transpiler` when the `loader` argument contains non-Latin-1 (UTF-16) characters, now properly returns a `TypeError` instead of panicking

### Module resolver[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#module-resolver)

*   Fixed: wildcard `exports` patterns (e.g. `"./*": "./dist/packages/*"`) failing to resolve subpaths containing `@` characters, such as `test-pkg/@scope/sub/index.js`. The resolver incorrectly treated the `@` in the subpath as a version delimiter, causing resolution to fail even though the file existed on disk. This notably affected `ember-source@6.12` and its `@ember/*`, `@glimmer/*`, and `@simple-dom/*` subpackages.
*   Fixed: crash in the module resolver when a previously inaccessible directory (e.g. due to `EACCES`) becomes readable again, caused by reading a cached error entry as a valid pointer
*   Fixed: use-after-free when resolving module specifiers containing both a query string (`?`) and non-ASCII characters (e.g. `import("./target.js?v=café")`), which could cause crashes or corrupted resolved paths
*   Fixed: use-after-free crash when resolving `http://`, `https://`, or `//` specifiers containing non-ASCII characters
*   Fixed: a use-after-free in the runtime auto-install path where `enqueueDependencyToRoot` could read from a dangling pointer into the lockfile's dependency buffer after it was reallocated by `fromNPM`
*   Fixed: auto-install resolution corruption where resolving a package's subpath (e.g. `nanoid/non-secure`) could fail with "Cannot find module" after auto-installing a second package, due to cached directory info pointing at a reused threadlocal buffer
*   Fixed: memory leak when resolving `tsconfig.json` files with `extends` chains — intermediate `TSConfigJSON` structs and their `paths` maps were never freed, causing repeated leaks on every HMR reload or `FileSystemRouter.reload()` call
*   Fixed: memory leak in `BunString__toThreadSafe` where the original `StringImpl` reference was never released when creating an isolated copy for thread safety, causing one leaked `StringImpl` per call in code paths like `Bun.file()` and async `fs.write()`

### Dev server / HMR[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#dev-server-hmr)

*   Fixed: stale asset index in Bun's dev server causing panics or crashes when one CSS file had a syntax error and another CSS file was subsequently edited
*   Fixed: use-after-free crash in Bun's dev server (`Bun.serve` with framework) when a `"use client"` directive is removed from a component that had a pending resolution failure, causing the directory watcher to read freed memory on the next file change
*   Fixed: double-free crash in Bun's dev server when shutting down after a directory watch resolves a previously-failing import dependency
*   Fixed: HMR bundles crashing with `X is not a function` when a file has multiple `import { ... } from` statements referencing the same barrel package with `sideEffects: false` (regression from barrel import optimization in v1.3.0)
*   Fixed: use-after-free crash in `bun dev` when saving files in editors that use atomic rename (vim, emacs, IntelliJ) — the dev server's incremental graph stored pointers into a buffer that could be reallocated by the file watcher thread before the bundler consumed them
*   Fixed: `bun dev` on Linux dropping file change notifications when multiple inotify events were coalesced into a single batch — e.g. an atomic-save creating a temp file and renaming it over the target in quick succession would silently lose the rename, leaving the file unwatched until restart
*   Fixed: `bun --hot` on macOS stopping to detect file changes after the first atomic write (temp file + rename) when watching multiple imported modules, causing the module graph to oscillate between old and new state
*   Fixed: `--hot` mode could print wrong source locations or silently drop errors when a file-watcher event arrived between a module's rejection and its error being reported — the reload now defers until the error is printed against the correct sourcemap

### `bun build --compile`[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#bun-build-compile)

*   Fixed: ELF layout regression causing some executables on WSL1 to fail with `ENOEXEC`
*   Fixed: out-of-bounds write in `toUTF16Alloc` when handling invalid UTF-8 input in Windows `bun build --compile` metadata flag

### CSS Parser[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#css-parser)

*   Fixed: CSS `background-clip` with vendor prefixes and multi-layer backgrounds could cause a double-free crash (≥2 background layers) and incorrect output where prefixed clip values were silently dropped instead of being flushed as separate declarations

### bun test[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#bun-test)

*   Fixed: crash in `bun test --isolate` on macOS ARM64 caused by the concurrent garbage collector visiting a half-initialized global object during test isolation swaps
*   Fixed: `bun test --isolate` and `bun test --parallel` crashing with segfaults when test files load native NAPI addon whose deferred finalizers outlive the file's global object. The `--parallel` coordinator also no longer silently retries crashed workers, which previously masked panics and let the run exit 0. Fatal signals (SIGSEGV, SIGABRT, etc.) now abort the entire test run with a clear error message.
*   Fixed: `bun test --changed` silently skipping test files whose only dependency path to a changed source file went through a tsconfig `paths` alias with a bare-looking key (e.g. `@/*`, `~/*`, `components/*`). The resolver's `packages=external` short-circuit was incorrectly marking these aliased imports as external before tsconfig `paths` could resolve them.
*   Fixed: `test.each()` / `describe.each()` table arrays could be garbage collected between the `.each(arr)` call and the subsequent `("name", cb)` invocation, causing callbacks to receive corrupted data or throwing `Expected array, got …` errors
*   Fixed: crash when a custom asymmetric matcher's implementation throws an exception during `.asymmetricMatch()` — the exception is now properly propagated to JavaScript instead of triggering an internal assertion failure
*   Fixed: `mock.module` / `vi.mock` calling the module resolver before validating the callback argument, which caused unexpected behavior

### Bun Shell[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#bun-shell)

This release fixes over 70 bugs with the Bun Shell.

*   Fixed: `cd` in Bun's shell hanging forever when encountering errno values other than `ENOTDIR`/`ENOENT`/`ENAMETOOLONG` (e.g. `EACCES`, `ELOOP`, `EIO`). Now properly reports the error to stderr and exits with code 1.
*   Fixed: a crash in Bun's shell when `cd` or `.cwd()` received a path longer than 4096 bytes — oversized paths now correctly return `ENAMETOOLONG` instead of segfaulting
*   Fixed: `[[ -f path ]]` in Bun Shell incorrectly returned true for directories, character devices, sockets, and FIFOs instead of only regular files
*   Fixed: shell tilde expansion dropping path segments after command substitutions in compound words (e.g. `echo ~/$(echo bin)/subdir` now correctly outputs `/home/user/bin/subdir` instead of `/home/user/bin`)

### TypeScript types[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#typescript-types)

*   Fixed: `bun-types` FFI type declarations failing to compile under `tsgo` (TypeScript native preview) due to duplicate computed property keys in `FFITypeToArgsType` and `FFITypeToReturnsType` interfaces

### Windows[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#windows)

*   Fixed: `Bun.connect()` on Windows named pipes could crash (heap-buffer-overflow under ASAN) or leak memory on connection close due to the socket handlers being incorrectly marked as server mode instead of client mode
*   Fixed: heap buffer overflows in Windows path normalization (`normalizePathWindows`) that could cause heap corruption when handling paths near or exceeding the 32,767 UTF-16 code unit limit. Affected code paths include UTF-8 to UTF-16 conversion, device paths (`\\.\`), absolute path normalization, separator-free paths, and relative path joining with `dirfd`. Now properly returns `ENAMETOOLONG` instead of writing out of bounds.
*   Fixed: crash on Windows (`panic: integer overflow`) when tearing down hundreds of spawned child processes during process exit, caused by an unsigned integer underflow in the libuv event loop's `active_handles` counter
*   Fixed: a panic on Windows when resolving error names from libuv error codes (e.g. `ENOENT`, `EBADF`) due to an integer overflow in internal errno translation (@dylan-conway)
*   Fixed: a crash on Windows (`Panic: invalid enum value`) when libuv returned unmapped error codes during file system operations like `fs.readFile`

### CLI and runtime[#](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.14#cli-and-runtime)

When piping Bun's output to tools like `less`, `fzf`, or `fx` (e.g. `bun script.js | less`), Bun would unconditionally restore its startup terminal (termios) snapshot at exit. Because termios state belongs to the underlying `/dev/pts/*` device — not the file descriptor — this would overwrite the raw mode that the downstream pager had already set, leaving it unresponsive to keypresses.

```
# Before: 'q' does nothing in less — terminal is stuck in cooked/line-buffered mode
bun app.js | less

# After: less, fzf, fx, and other pagers work correctly
bun app.js | less
```

The fix gates the exit-time `tcsetattr` on whether Bun actually modified the terminal during its lifetime. When Bun is a pipeline producer (stdout is a pipe), fds it never touched are now left alone at exit. When stdout is a TTY (e.g. `bun run vim`, crash handler, `--watch` reload), the unconditional restore is preserved so the shell prompt always comes back to a usable state.

#### Other CLI/runtime fixes

*   Fixed: `bun -p` with top-level `await` expressions now returns the final completion value instead of the first awaited value — e.g. `bun -p '(await 1) + 1'` now correctly prints `2` instead of `1`
